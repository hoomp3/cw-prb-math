# cw-prb-math
This package uses [ethnum](https://github.com/nlordell/ethnum-rs) to implement the [prb-math](https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-math) library in Rust. It re-exports [ethnum] by default and is meant to be used with CosmWasm smart contracts.

Not all prb-math functions are implemented yet, but the current implementation are up to date as of prb-math v4.0.1.
